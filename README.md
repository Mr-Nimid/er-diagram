This ER diagram models a user authentication and management system with the following key components:

Users: This table stores user details such as a unique identifier (UUID), email, hashed password, activation status, and the account creation timestamp.
Roles: Defines various roles (with a unique name) that can be assigned to users.
UserRoles: Acts as a junction table establishing a many-to-many relationship between Users and Roles, indicating which roles are assigned to each user.
LoginAttemptLogs: Logs each login attempt made by a user, capturing details like the timestamp, success status, IP address, and user agent. This helps in monitoring and auditing authentication activities.
PasswordChangeLogs: Keeps a record of when a userâ€™s password was changed and the IP address from which the change was initiated, providing a trail for security audits.
JwtSessions: Manages JWT (JSON Web Token) sessions by storing token details, including when they were issued, when they expire, and whether they have been revoked, which supports session management and security.

This ER diagram outlines an e-commerce system that manages products, promotions, shopping carts, orders, transactions, and history logs, providing a comprehensive view of the sales and fulfillment process.

Product: Stores product details such as a unique identifier, name, description, price, stock quantity, and audit information like creation and update dates and the associated user details.
Promotion: Captures details of discount offers with fields for a unique id, promotion code, description, discount values (both fixed and percentage), validity periods, and audit metadata.
Cart and CartItem: A shopping cart is associated with a user and can contain multiple cart items. Each cart item links a specific product to the cart along with the quantity selected.
Order and OrderItem: An order, tied to a user and potentially a promotion, records order details including the order date, status, and total amount. Order items detail individual products purchased, including unit price, quantity, and any discount applied.
Transaction: Represents the financial aspect of an order by recording payment details such as the method, status, amount, and payment timestamp.
HistoryLog: Provides a tracking mechanism for orders by recording various actions performed on an order, who performed them, and when.
Relationships:

A Product can be part of multiple OrderItems (included in orders) and CartItems (added to carts).
A Promotion can be applied to multiple Orders and can discount multiple OrderItems.
A Cart can contain several CartItems.
An Order can have multiple OrderItems, can generate multiple Transactions, and is tracked by multiple HistoryLogs.
